<h2>Hotaru Wants Heaven</h2>
This was a project for my Introduction to Game Development and Design class. We had a week to make the game; all the assets were drawn by me.

This was the project that introduced me to programming. It was the first time I ever used the game engine Unity and was tasked to develop this game in C# from scratch. 
This includes a logic script for the score and the sound effects, a script for the player (the bird) and its movement, a script for the moving columns (which get destroyed 
when off-screen in order to save power), and a script for death borders above and below the screen so that the player cannot go up or fall down forever.  Additionally, I 
learned to import my drawn assets from Adobe Photoshop and assign them to game objects, as well as to use the particle system (which I used for the clouds).  Finally, I 
learned the very basics of UI creation: a menu screen with "Play" and "Quit" buttons as well as a game over screen with "Play Again" and "Main Menu" buttons.

This is the very first video game I ever created.
